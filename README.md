  * [Modin: Pandas on ray](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/modin-pandas-on-ray-october-2018/). This is interesting as they also provide a way to fallback to Pandas if the API is not implemented (yet).
  * Spark: use `partitionBy()` can help improve performance of subsequence `groupByKey()`
  * Pandas now supports [read / write](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_parquet.html) parquet files.

  * Python: Use `isinstance(x, numbers.Number)` to check if an instance is number
  * [tornado.httpclient only handles 10 concurrent requests by default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33411493/max-clients-limit-reached-request-queued-tornado)
  * Pandas None handling is confusing:
    * DateTime has `NaT` and Float has a `NaN`, but boolean with null value will become object. So `DataFrame({"test": [True, False]})` has dtype is `bool` but `DataFrame({"test": [True, None]})` has dtype is `object`. Unless you force the dtype explicitly. Maybe we need a `NaB` type ...
    * In fact, integer will be converted to float if there is a None value as well.
    * For number bigger than uint64, you will need to cast to object.
