This repository is for keeping track of my reading and learning, inspired by many other [TIL repositories](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=til&ref=simplesearch). These are too short for a blog post, too long for a tweet ðŸ˜‰.

  * Pandas has a [Timestamp](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.Timestamp.html) type that is compatible with python datetime.

  * [Modin: Pandas on ray](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/modin-pandas-on-ray-october-2018/). This is interesting as they also provide a way to fallback to Pandas if the API is not implemented (yet).
  * Spark: use `partitionBy()` can help improve performance of subsequence `groupByKey()`
  * Pandas now supports [read / write](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_parquet.html) parquet files.

  * Terraform ebs_optmized flag is troublesome. There is even a [module](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ebs-optimized) to determined the default state for this flag.

  * [Brain of Things](https://dzone.com/articles/the-brain-of-things-and-home-automation): I heard it for a while, but I only really read about it today.

  * Fidelity has a [self-funded overdraft protection](https://www.fidelity.com/cash-management/faqs-cash-management-account), which automatically move money within accounts to avoid overdraft. Typical bank charges you interest as soon as the overdraft happens.
  * Chase Cardless ATM works with Apply Pay. You can just hold your phone near the icon to make the transaction.

  * Python: Use `isinstance(x, numbers.Number)` to check if an instance is number
  * [tornado.httpclient only handles 10 concurrent requests by default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33411493/max-clients-limit-reached-request-queued-tornado)
  * Pandas None handling is confusing:
    * DateTime has `NaT` and Float has a `NaN`, but boolean with null value will become object. So `DataFrame({"test": [True, False]})` has dtype is `bool` but `DataFrame({"test": [True, None]})` has dtype is `object`. Unless you force the dtype explicitly. Maybe we need a `NaB` type ...
    * In fact, integer will be converted to float if there is a None value as well.
    * For number bigger than uint64, you will need to cast to object.
