  * Python: Use `isinstance(x, numbers.Number)` to check if an instance is number
  * [tornado.httpclient only handles 10 concurrent requests by default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33411493/max-clients-limit-reached-request-queued-tornado)
  * Pandas None handling is confusing:
    * DateTime has `NaT` and Float has a `NaN`, but boolean with null value will become object. So `DataFrame({"test": [True, False]})` has dtype is `bool` but `DataFrame({"test": [True, None]})` has dtype is `object`. Unless you force the dtype explicitly. Maybe we need a `NaB` type ...
    * In fact, integer will be converted to float if there is a None value as well.
    * For number bigger than uint64, you will need to cast to object.
